# Hej!

I'm looking for a job as a Junior Frontend Web Developer. If you have one on offer, please do not hesitate to contact me:

gustav@gustavhersmann.com

Who am I?

I'm Gustav, a Swedish man currently living in Germany. I'm 43 years old. I've done many things in life up until this point. It's been a good journey, I've learned a lot. I like learning. The latest thing I've done is finish Coding Bootcamps Europe's web developer training. It was really fun, now I'm hoping to find a job that will continue the fun.

Wish me luck!
